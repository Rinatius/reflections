When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Pretty much always.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic sunchronisation can lead to unexpected errors and merging conflicts.
Besides, sometimes you actually want to leave some things on the local machine.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is a copy of a repository. Fork is a clone on GitHub. Branch is a version of code inside repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is the base for conflict resolution with remote repositories.
